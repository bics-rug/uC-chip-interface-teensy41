# The packet header identifies the instruction to be executed by the microcontroller.
# The headers are divided into sections for:
#   - General commands
#   - Interface-specific commands (PIN, AER, SPI, I2C, etc.)
#   - Configuration commands
#
# For simplicity, commands use the Data32bitPacket class with an empty value field.
